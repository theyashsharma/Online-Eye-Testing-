Abstract: The goal is to use the Pytorch library to create a Deep Learning model that can recognise eye illnesses using eye-fundus photos. Create a data pipeline capable of handling enormous volumes of data points, which is a crucial prerequisite for making the training process scalable.
 
Introduction :
Early diagnosis of ocular disorders such as diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and other diseases is a cost-effective and effective strategy to avert blindness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from vision impairments, with at least one billion of them having a vision impairment that might have been avoided. Rapid and automatic illness identification is crucial and urgent in lowering ophthalmologist workload and preventing patient visual damage. After taking high-quality medical eye fundus photos, computer vision and deep learning can automatically detect ocular illnesses. Using a variety of experiments and methodologies, this paper will show you how to create an advanced classification model using convolutional neural networks developed in the Pytorch framework.
